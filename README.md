# Stopwatch Project

This project implements a simple stopwatch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The stopwatch has three buttons: Start, Stop, and Reset.

## Functionality

- Clicking on the **Start** button initiates the stopwatch. The time starts counting up.
- Clicking on the **Stop** button pauses the stopwatch. Clicking **Start** again continues from where it left off.
- Clicking on the **Reset** button stops the clock and resets the time to zero.
